# Degenscan Intel Action Provider

Cross-asset market-event intelligence for agents: SEC filings, Fed/central-bank releases, regulator actions, earthquakes and storms, Nasdaq halts, DeFi hacks, Polymarket odds and Hyperliquid perp microstructure, normalized into one event schema and scored into per-asset impacts. Service: https://intel.degenscan.io (operator: Marbella Collins LLC, MIT). Information and analytics only — not investment advice.

## Actions

- `get_market_pulse` — last-hour event counts by class, high-severity count, venues open ($0.001)
- `get_market_events` — events since a window with per-asset impacts (direction, confidence, exposure path) ($0.005)
- `get_asset_brief` — one-call pre-trade brief for one asset ($0.10)
- `get_perp_derivs` — Hyperliquid funding, predicted funding by venue, OI, premium, flags ($0.003)

## Setup

No key needed for the free trial (100 calls/day/IP). Set `DEGENSCAN_INTEL_API_KEY` for a prepaid key (bought with USDC: `POST https://intel.degenscan.io/v1/keys/x402/pack_1k`, $5 = 1,000 calls) or a Stripe plan. For per-call USDC payments via x402, pass an x402-enabled requests.Session (see the x402 PyPI package):

```ts
from coinbase_agentkit import degenscan_intel_action_provider
provider = degenscan_intel_action_provider(api_key="...")  # or DEGENSCAN_INTEL_API_KEY env

```

## Network support
